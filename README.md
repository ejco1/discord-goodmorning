# Welcome to the Discord Good Morning Script.
This is a python script that you can trigger if you want to send a message to your servers without actually single-handedly going through to each server.

To keep things abstracted and hidden, I have everything linked to a config.json file and all properties are updated there.

## This iteration is if you wanted to run it through chat_gpt so that you don't need a list of variations.
### I didn't use it because it costs money to ping the API & I don't really care that much to do that, but I figured this information would be useful to someone down the road probably.


Thanks,
//Ethan
